CssCompressor
=============

A PHP script that compresses CSS on the fly but at the same time uses cache files. The cache files are automatically generated as soon as the CSS that need compression is updated. I created this script in order to use it in combination with a .htaccess REWRITE rules to compress every single stylesheet in my website.
